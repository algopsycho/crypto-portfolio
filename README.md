# crypto-portfolio
 
the goal of this code is to create an optimal crypto-portfolio with the top 12
cryptocurrency coins with the highest market caps.

i have used Modern Portfolio Theory, or also known as mean- variance analysis is a mathematical
process which allows the user to maximize returns for a given risk level.

this code takes an input 't' which represents an interval of time, to get their historical prices said interval. 

i have used mined data from the coincap api whose documentation is available at https://docs.coincap.io
